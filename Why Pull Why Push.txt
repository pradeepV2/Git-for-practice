Why to PUSH?
Working on a PRoject -> save the code changes on REPO
All changes are tracked, version control history is maintained

REPO will have history
-> Add the changes are committed to GITHUB


SECOND APPROACH : -
Why to PULL : -
Wanted to copy the code from github to Laptop Working Directory

-> git clone -> the GITHUB REPO will be cloned()
-> git fetch -> Copies the code from GITHUB to Local REPOSITORY
-> git merge -> Copies the code from Local REPOSITORY to Working Directory
-> git pull -> The code from GITHUB REPO


AUTHOR of the Code

-> Contributers push the code to MASTER/BRANCH
